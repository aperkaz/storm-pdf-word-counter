# storm-pdf-word-counter

Stream processing pipeline that performs the real time analysis of a folder of stored PDFs, using [Apache Storm](http://storm.apache.org/).

This following repo contains the Storm topology code and the instructions to run it locally with [Local Mode](http://storm.apache.org/releases/0.10.0/Local-mode.html). This simulates the behavior of the topology as it was deployed into a cluster.

## Requirements

  * [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) - virtual environment manager.
  * [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) - general purpose virtualizer .
  * SSH client, such as [PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/).
